			<h1>Lab 4 - Pseudocoding and Problem solving </h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Get in the habit of thinking in terms of pseudocoding before jumping into coding</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One problem I had was having the pseudocoding that I did in the index.html showing up randomly at the bottom of the webpage. I thought that adding the "//" meant that it was just a comment and it wouldn't show up. I realized after that the "//" only applied in the js and so I moved that pseudocoding into the results section instead.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>While doing this assignment I was a bit confused on how to make the game of rock, paper, scissors into a computer program. I thought hard about the steps of the game and even though its a simple game I was struggling with realizing it in this new form. I put in a lot of effort into this assignment, working on making this webpage look nice because my other labs are kinda ugly looking.  </p>

					<p>This is the psuedocoding made for the game of Rock, Paper, Scissors</p>
					<pre><code>
						//prompt the user to enter rock, paper, or scissors
						//accept user input of rock, paper, or scissors
						//computer randomly choose rock, paper, or scissors
						//reveal both computer choice and user choice
						//test of win or draw condition
						  //User rock + computer paper = computer win
						  //User rock + computer scissors = user win
						  //User paper + computer rock = user win
						  //User paper + computer paper = draw
						  //User paper + computer scissors = computer win
						  //User scissors + computer rock = computer win
						  //User scissors + computer paper = user win
						  //User scissors + computer scissors = draw
						</pre></code>
