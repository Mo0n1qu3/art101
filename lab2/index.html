					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>With a partner, create a basic HTML file and a CSS style file, edit it, view it in your browser, and inspect it.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>When first editing this HTML file, I struggled with getting the webpage to show properly. This was fixed by renaming the file, I orignally had forgotten to add the ".html" to the end of the file name. I'm learning that a small mistake can change the whole output. Going forward catching these little differences is going to be difficult. (im not the most attentive person)</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The assignment went well for me. It was a bit of a struggle to remember how everything functions and the correct code for each of the changes. I wish I was able to do more to customize these pages but I just don't really know how yet. I'm proud I was able to get the links to work though. Go click them! they're the most advanced thing I can do right now. </p>
