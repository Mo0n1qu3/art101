                    <p>Working with your partner, experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>

                    <h2>Problems</h2>
                    <p>When completing the task 2 of experimenting in the console I was very confused. I was unable to get my console to return my output to me. At first I thought it was a syntax error and I tried changing up where each variable was placed in the code but since Wes gave us the format in the lab I figured that wasn't the problem but I didn't understand what exactly I was doing incorrectly. I asked my partner and she also wasn't sure so I enlisted the help of my housemate who is a computer science major. She helped me figure out that I needed to put console.log in the code for it to show up in the console and also helped walk me through the process so I understood. Afterwards I redid the code with comments so that I could make sure I actually understood the reasoning and it was really helpful. Shoutout to Laurel!</p>
                    <p>I also ran into a bit of an inconvience because the console was only so big and when I was writing a lot of code I would have to restart in another tab because the page only went so far down. </p>
