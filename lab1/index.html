					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>1. Working with others helps you solve problems and inspire each other.
						2. You will be a better artist if you get to know the modern web.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>Since this Lab was based on exploration, I didn't run into any problems. Happy that I can say that now because I know the other labs won't be as simple and straightforward. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This assignment went well for me. I enjoyed being able to see the different ways artists used webpages for their practice. It was also nice to have an excuse to play webgames. </p>
