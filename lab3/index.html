			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Working with a partner, further create a local file structure on your computer, add index.html files, and upload to the server.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I struggled a bit with understanding which file types VScode accepted. I was able to utilize online conversion websites to change my HEIC files to PNGs.  </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>The assignment went well for me. I'm still working on customize the webpage to look more aestically pleasing. I want to do more work on the website outside of the labs. I've found that I code pretty slowly because I'm still learning, so actually making the website look nice has been a bit second to making it run correctly. I'm working on adding in cooler features I just need to figure out how. </p>
